#My plan to advance in JS in 2018#

My plan is to grow some JS muscle before I start my first small project.

Things to do on nodeschool:
- learnyounode training (100% done)
- javascripting (100% done) - that was trivial
- how-to-npm
- learnyouhtml
- functional javascript
- Bytewiser
- Javascript best practices


Things to do on codewars:
- 10 katas in April (0% done)

Things to read before sleep:
- Java Script ultimate guide small subject a day


Then I will be ready to start my first project.
